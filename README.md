This is about me

Notes:
- Project images and CV are stored in `assets/` at the repository root.
	- `assets/Procets.jpg` - Project 1 placeholder (duplicate of Projects.jpg)
	- `assets/Projects.jpg` and `assets/Projects1.jpg` - project thumbnails
	- `assets/Cv.pdf` - placeholder CV (used by Download CV / Resume buttons)

When opening `Protfollio/index.html` in a browser, serve the project root so the assets folder is reachable (example: `python3 -m http.server` from the repo root then open `/Protfollio/index.html`).
